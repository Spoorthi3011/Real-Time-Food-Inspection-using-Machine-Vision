# Real-Time Food Inspection: Leveraging Machine Vision for Quality Assurance

This project implements a machine vision-based system to inspect food quality, particularly focusing on detecting rotten regions in fruits like apples.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- ✅ 94% Validation Accuracy
- 🧠 CNN-based model with real-time capability (50ms/image)
- 🍎 Focus on apple rot detection; extensible to other produce
- 📈 High precision (96%) and F1 score (0.94)
